    <h3>Basket of Gold</h3>
    <img src="flower1.jpg">
    <p>With bright yellow, low-growing flowers, no wonder where the Basket of Gold got its name. Given its short height
        and golden color, this makes for a perfect addition to a rock garden or xeriscape.</p>

    <h3>Bee Balm</h3>
    <img src="flower2.jpg">
    <p>With the name Bee balm, this ornamental flower attracts not only bees, but hummingbirds and other beneficial pollinators.
        Bee balms are highly valued for their deep scarlet color, but also come in blue, violet, white and pink.</p>

    <h3>Astilbe</h3>
    <img src="flower3.jpg">
    <p>Astilbes are deceptively delicate with their long, fern-like flowers. These flowers can actually withstand damp soil and shade,
        while still growing between one to six feet tall. Perfect to add for a pop of color to a garden that typically gets little sunlight.</p>
